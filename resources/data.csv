Hi Michael,

I recently received an invoice for the products we purchased from your company in July. I noticed that we were charged an additional $100 dollars because our payment was two months overdue. I would like to explain why we failed to make these payments, and hope that you will reverse the charges immediately.
At the end of July, our department underwent restructuring and Brian Davies, our Finance Manager, was asked to leave. Unfortunately, in the process of changing managers a few files were misplaced, including the one containing all of our office supplies invoices. I hope you will accept my request so that we continue doing business with your company in the future.
